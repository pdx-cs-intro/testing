# Gauss's Sum: 1+2+â€¦+k = k * (k - 1) / 2
# So the largest number of rows that can be made is
# the largest integer k such that

#   k * (k - 1) / 2 <= n
#
# Using the quadratic formula, we find
#
#   k = floor(-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * n) / 2)
#
# Substituting k back into Gauss's Sum, we then get
# the number of balls in the triangle.
